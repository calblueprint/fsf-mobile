The agreements for both LOT and\nOIN have substantial limitations and exclusions. \u003ca href="https://lotnet.com/how-lot-works/"\u003eLOT\u003c/a\u003e only deals\nwith the problem of patent trolling by non-practicing entities. OIN\'s\nnonaggression agreement only covers a \u003ca href="https://www.openinventionnetwork.com/joining-oin/linux-system/"\u003edefined list of free software\npackages\u003c/a\u003e, and any OIN member, including Microsoft, can withdraw\ncompletely with thirty days notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these limitations in mind, FSF welcomes the announcements, and\ncalls on Microsoft to take additional steps to continue the momentum\ntoward a complete resolution:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1) Make a clear, unambiguous statement that it has ceased all patent\n  infringement claims on the use of Linux in Android.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2) Work within OIN to expand the definition of what it calls the\n  "Linux System" so that the list of packages protected from patents\n  actually includes everything found in a GNU/Linux system. This\n  means, for example, removing the current arbitrary and very\n  intentional exclusions for packages in the area of multimedia -- one\n  of the primary patent minefields for free software. We suggest that\n  this definition include every package in Debian\'s default public\n  package repository.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3) Use the past patent royalties extorted from free software to fund\n  the effective abolition of \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e patents covering ideas in software.\n  This can be done by supporting grassroots efforts like the FSF\'s\n  \u003ca href="http://endsoftpatents.org"\u003eEnd Software Patents\u003c/a\u003e campaign, or by Microsoft directly urging\n  the US Congress to pass legislation \u003ca href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/limit-patent-effect.html"\u003eexcluding software from the\n  effects of patents\u003c/a\u003e, or both. Without this, the threats can come\n  back with a future leadership change at Microsoft, or with changes\n  in OIN\'s own corporate structure and licensing arrangements. This is\n  also the best way for Microsoft to show that it does not intend to\n  use patents as a weapon against \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e free software, beyond just\n  that free software which is part of OIN\'s specific list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe FSF appreciates what Microsoft joining OIN seems to signal about\nits changing attitude toward computational idea patents. Taking these\nthree additional steps would remove all doubt and any potential for\nbacksliding. We look forward to future collaboration on fully\naddressing the threat of patents to free software development and\ncomputer user freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe FSF will also continue to monitor the situation, for any signs\nthat Microsoft intends to still continue patent aggression, in ways\npermitted by the terms of LOT and OIN.

DRM creates a damaged\ngood: it prevents you from doing what would be possible without\nit.

Given\n  this power, corporations like Amazon could fully disappear a book\n  from existence if they chose, committing a massive digital\n  book-burning.

For a decade, LibrePlanet has brought together thousands of\ndiverse voices and knowledge bases, including free software\ndevelopers, policy experts, activists, hackers, students, and people\nwho have just begun to learn about free software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLibrePlanet 2019 will feature sessions for all ages and experience\nlevels, including newcomers. Sharon Woods, general counsel for the\nDefense Digital Service (US Department of Defense) said, “Last year\nwas my first LibrePlanet... I walked away a complete believer in free\nsoftware.” In just the last three years, over a thousand people from\naround the world have attended LibrePlanet, with many more\nparticipating online by watching the free software-powered livestream,\njoining the conversation on IRC, or viewing nearly 40 hours of\narchived video on \u003ca href="https://media.libreplanet.org/"\u003ethe FSF\'s GNU MediaGoblin instance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLibrePlanet 2019\'s theme is "Trailblazing Free Software." In 1983, the\nfree software movement was born with the announcement of the GNU\nProject. FSF founder Richard Stallman saw the dangers of proprietary\ncode from the beginning: when code was kept secret from users, they\nwould be controlled by the technology they used, instead of vice\nversa. In contrast, free software emphasized a community-oriented\nphilosophy of sharing code freely, enabling people to understand how\nthe programs they used worked, to build off of each other\'s code, to\npay it forward by sharing their own code, and to create useful\nsoftware that treated users fairly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e"Every year, ideas are introduced, discussed, and developed at\nLibrePlanet that advance the free software movement and help\ntechnology and associated law actually serve the people using them,"\nsaid FSF executive director John Sullivan. "People will leave the next\nedition doubly motivated to chart a path away from dependency on\nunfree software companies like Facebook, Apple, Uber, and Microsoft,\nand with new knowledge about tools to help them do so."\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he identified control over one\'s own computer as a requirement\nfor ethical, trustworthy computing, Stallman anticipated some of the\nmost toxic aspects of today\'s proprietary software-filled world,\nincluding Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), bulk surveillance,\nand \u003ca href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html"\u003eService as a Software Substitute (SaaSS)\u003c/a\u003e. With a new and\ngrowing generation of free software enthusiasts, we can take this\nconference as an opportunity to discuss both the present and the\nfuture of the free software movement. Using the Four Freedoms as a\nlitmus test for ethical computing, we ask, "How will free software\ncontinue to bring to life trailblazing, principled new technologies\nand new approaches to the world?"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003eCall for Proposals\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLibrePlanet 2019\'s talks and hands-on workshops can be for developers,\nyoung people, newcomers to free software, activists looking for\ntechnology that aligns with their ideals, policymakers, hackers,\nartists, and tinkerers. Potential talks should examine or utilize free\nsoftware, copyleft, and related issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e"Each year, newcomers and longtime free software activists of all ages\nsurprise us with unique ideas they propose to explore at LibrePlanet,"\nsaid Georgia Young, program manager at the FSF.

        '\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, USA – Saturday, March 24, 2018\u003c/strong\u003e – The\n  Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced the winners of the\n  2017 Free Software Awards at a ceremony held during the LibrePlanet\n  2018 conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n  (MIT). FSF president Richard M. Stallman presented the Award for Projects of Social\n  Benefit  and the Award for the Advancement of Free Software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href="https://www.fsf.org/awards/sb-award/"\u003eAward for Projects of Social Benefit\u003c/a\u003e is presented to a\nproject or team responsible for applying free software, or the ideas\nof the free software movement, to intentionally and significantly\nbenefit society. This award stresses the use of free software in\nservice to humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, \u003ca href="https://publiclab.org/"\u003ePublic Lab\u003c/a\u003e received the award, which was accepted by\nLiz Barry, Public Lab co-founder, organizer, and director of community\ndevelopment, and Jeff Warren, Public Lab co-founder and research\ndirector, on behalf of the entire Public Lab community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublic Lab is a community and non-profit organization with the goal of\ndemocratizing science to address environmental issues. Their\ncommunity-created tools and techniques utilize free software and\nlow-cost devices to enable people at any level of technical skill to investigate\nenvironmental concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStallman noted how crucial Public Lab\'s work is to the global\ncommunity, and also how their use of free software is crucial to their\nmission, saying that "the environmental and social problems caused by\nglobal heating are so large that they cannot rationally be\ndenied. When studies concerning the causes and the effects of global\nheating, or the environmental impact of pollution, industry, and\npolicy choices, are conducted using proprietary software, that is a\ngratuitous obstacle to replicating them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e"Public Lab gets the tools to study and protect the world into\nthe hands of everyone -- and since they are free (libre) software,\nthey respect both the people who use them, and the community that\ndepends on the results."\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff Warren, speaking on behalf of the Public Lab community, added\nthat using free software is part of their larger mission to take\nscience out of the hands of the experts and allow everyday people to\nparticipate: "At Public Lab, we believe that generating knowledge is a\npowerful thing. We aim to open research from the exclusive hands of\nscientific experts. By doing so, communities facing environmental\njustice issues are able to own the science and advocate for the\nchanges they want to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e"Building free software, hardware, and open data is\nfundamental to our work in the Public Lab community, as we see it as a\nkey part of our commitment to equity in addressing environmental\ninjustice."\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src="https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/libreplanet/2018/highlights/publiclab.JPG" alt="Public Lab folks with award" width="100%" /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href="https://www.fsf.org/awards/fs-award"\u003eAward for the Advancement of Free Software\u003c/a\u003e goes to an\nindividual who has made a great contribution to the progress and\ndevelopment of free software, through activities that accord with the\nspirit of free software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year, it was presented to Karen Sandler, the Executive Director\nof the \u003ca href="https://sfconservancy.org/"\u003eSoftware Freedom Conservancy\u003c/a\u003e, as well as a perennial\nLibrePlanet speaker and friend to the FSF. She is known for her\nadvocacy for free software, particularly in relation to the software\non medical devices: she led an initiative advocating for free software\non implantable medical devices after exploring the issues surrounding\nthe software on her own implanted medical device (a defibrillator),\nwhich regulates an inherited heart condition. Sandler has served as\nthe Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation, where she now serves\non the Board of Directors, and before that, she was General Counsel of\nthe Software Freedom Law Center. Finally, she co-organizes\n\u003ca href="https://www.outreachy.org/"\u003eOutreachy\u003c/a\u003e, the award-winning outreach program that organizes paid\ninternships in free software for people who are typically\nunderrepresented in these projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStallman praised Sandler\'s dedication to free software, emphasizing\nhow sharing her personal experience has provided a window into the\nimportance of free software for a broader audience: "Her vivid warning\nabout backdoored nonfree software in implanted medical devices has\nbrought the issue home to people who never wrote a line of code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e"Her efforts, usually not in the public eye, to provide pro bono legal\nadvice to free software organizations and to organize infrastructure\nfor free software projects and copyleft defense, have been equally\nhelpful."\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandler explained that her dedication to promoting free software was inevitable, given her personal experience: "Coming to terms with a dangerous heart condition should never have cost \nme fundamental control over the technology that my life relies on," she said. "The \ntwists and turns of my own life, including my professional work at \nConservancy, led me to understand how software freedom is essential to \nsociety. This issue is personal not just for me but for anyone who \nrelies on software, and today that means every single person."\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src="https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/libreplanet/2018/highlights/karen_sandler.jpg" alt="Karen Sandler with award" width="100%" /\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout the Free Software Foundation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to\npromoting computer users\' right to use, study, copy, modify, and\nredistribute computer programs.

We\'ve come to expect\nthat proprietary software\'s sinister aspects are embedded in\nsoftware, digital devices, and our lives, too: we expect that our\nphones monitor our activity and share that data with big\ncompanies, that governments enforce digital restrictions\nmanagement (DRM), and that even our activity on social Web sites\nis out of our control.
